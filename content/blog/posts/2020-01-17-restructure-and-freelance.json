We had our first client on Wednesday 15th January, An awesome new live audience podcast event hosted by [Northern Bear .](https://thenorthernbear.co.uk/) The sustainability based podcast was a triumph and we hope to work on the further events in the future. This is a revelutionary moment for Furem, being our first client it has a special place in our heart! Following this triump we are going to be doing some restructuring, after much deliberation we have decided to remove Cayman Flynn from our senior team, we are sad to say goodbye, but this is all for good reason! Josh is still going to be staying CEO and is going to be a lot more freelance using Furem as his official freelance media agency. - We hope everyone had a great christmas and we wish everyone a happy new year! \n\n\\- Josh"
